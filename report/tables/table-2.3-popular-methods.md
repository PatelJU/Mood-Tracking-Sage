# Table 2.3: Popular Visualization Methods for Mood Data

| Visualization Method | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages | Implementation in Pro Mood Tracker |
|----------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|
| Calendar View | Color-coded calendar showing mood entries by day | - Intuitive time-based overview<br>- Easy to spot patterns by day of week<br>- Familiar format for users | - Limited detail about each entry<br>- Color interpretation may vary<br>- Space constraints on mobile | Implemented using custom calendar component with color mapping for mood levels |
| Line Chart | Line graph showing mood levels over time | - Clear trend visualization<br>- Easy to identify fluctuations<br>- Good for long-term patterns | - Can get cluttered with multiple data points<br>- Less effective for categorical data<br>- Requires interpolation for missing days | Implemented using Recharts library with customizable date ranges and smoothing options |
| Bar Chart | Vertical bars representing mood distribution or frequency | - Clear comparison of categories<br>- Good for showing distribution<br>- Works well with counted data | - Less effective for time series<br>- Can be misleading with scale choices<br>- Limited detail on individual entries | Implemented using Chart.js with mood distribution by category and time period |
| Radar/Spider Chart | Multi-axis chart showing mood across different dimensions | - Good for multi-factor analysis<br>- Shows relationships between variables<br>- Compact representation | - Can be difficult to interpret<br>- Limited by number of axes<br>- Requires normalization | Implemented using Recharts for time-of-day analysis and factor correlation |
| Heatmap | Grid-based visualization with color intensity | - Good for dense data sets<br>- Shows patterns and clusters<br>- Works well for time-based data | - Color interpretation challenges<br>- Requires sufficient data density<br>- May need legend explanation | Implemented for year-view of mood data with intensity mapping |
| Pie/Donut Chart | Circular chart showing proportion of mood categories | - Shows distribution clearly<br>- Familiar to most users<br>- Visually appealing | - Limited to showing proportions<br>- Can be misleading with too many segments<br>- No time dimension | Implemented using Chart.js for mood distribution by category |
| Scatter Plot | Points plotted to show relationship between two variables | - Good for correlation analysis<br>- Shows individual data points<br>- Identifies outliers | - Can get cluttered with many points<br>- Requires two continuous variables<br>- Pattern recognition may be difficult | Implemented for weather correlation analysis |
| Bubble Chart | Enhanced scatter plot with size dimension | - Adds third dimension to data<br>- Good for multi-variable analysis<br>- Visually engaging | - Can be difficult to compare bubble sizes<br>- Limited by screen space<br>- Complex to interpret | Considered for future implementation |
| Stream Graph | Flowing, stacked area chart showing changes over time | - Visually appealing flow representation<br>- Good for showing changing proportions<br>- Highlights patterns over time | - Can be difficult to read exact values<br>- Area comparisons can be challenging<br>- Requires significant data points | Considered for future implementation |
| Sankey Diagram | Flow diagram showing relationships and transitions | - Shows relationships between categories<br>- Visualizes transitions or flows<br>- Good for complex relationships | - Complex to implement<br>- Requires structured relationship data<br>- Space-intensive | Implemented using d3-sankey for mood transition analysis |
