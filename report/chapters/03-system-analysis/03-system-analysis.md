## 3.4 Database Design

Although the Pro Mood Tracker application primarily uses client-side storage rather than a traditional server-based database, the data structure design follows database design principles. This section outlines the logical data model, relationships, and storage implementation.

### 3.4.1 Storage Strategy

The application utilizes the following storage mechanisms:

1. **Local Storage**: Primary storage method using the browser's localStorage API
   - Persistent across sessions and browser restarts
   - Limited to string data (JSON serialization used)
   - Approximately 5-10MB capacity depending on browser

2. **Session Storage**: Used for temporary session-specific data
   - Cleared when browser session ends
   - Same string-only limitation as localStorage
   - Used for temporary form data and session state

3. **Indexed DB** (future implementation):
   - Object-oriented database for more complex data structures
   - Larger storage capacity
   - Support for complex queries and indexing

### 3.4.2 Data Relationships

The following entity-relationship diagram illustrates the relationships between key data entities in the application:

```
+---------------+       +---------------+       +---------------+
|               |       |               |       |               |
|     User      |<------+  MoodEntry    +------>|    Weather    |
|               |       |               |       |               |
+-------+-------+       +-------+-------+       +---------------+
        |                       |
        |                       |
        v                       v
+-------+-------+       +-------+-------+       +---------------+
|               |       |               |       |               |
|    Badge      |       |   Activity    |<----->|  MoodEntry    |
|               |       |               |       |               |
+---------------+       +---------------+       +---------------+
        ^
        |
+-------+-------+
|               |
| Achievement   |
|               |
+---------------+
```

### 3.4.3 Data Storage Implementation

The application uses a structured approach to local storage organization:

1. **Namespace Prefixing**: All storage keys are prefixed with 'proMoodTracker:' to avoid conflicts

2. **Entity-based Storage**: Data is organized by entity type:
   - `proMoodTracker:user` - User profile and settings
   - `proMoodTracker:moodEntries` - Array of mood entry objects
   - `proMoodTracker:badges` - Earned badges and achievements
   - `proMoodTracker:themes` - Custom theme definitions
   - `proMoodTracker:stats` - Cached statistical calculations

3. **Data Serialization**: All data is serialized to JSON format for storage and deserialized when retrieved

4. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Non-essential data is stored separately to minimize main data payload
   - Historical entries beyond a certain age may be archived separately
   - Optional compression for large datasets (future implementation)

### 3.4.4 Data Integrity and Security

To ensure data integrity and security, the application implements several measures:

1. **Validation**: All data is validated before storage to ensure format compliance

2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for storage failures

3. **Backup Reminders**: Users are periodically reminded to export their data

4. **Data Encryption** (future implementation): Sensitive data will be encrypted

5. **Version Tagging**: Data structures include version information for migration support

6. **Atomic Updates**: Critical updates use temporary storage to prevent data corruption

### 3.4.5 Data Migration Strategy

As the application evolves, data structure changes are managed through:

1. **Schema Versioning**: Data structures include version information

2. **Migration Functions**: Code to upgrade data from previous formats

3. **Backward Compatibility**: New versions can read old data formats

4. **Migration Notifications**: Users are informed when data migration occurs

5. **Rollback Support**: Critical migrations maintain backup of original data
